# GHÂSH

> “As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment
> I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; they
> seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was ghâsh:
> that is “fire”. Then something came into the chamber – I felt it through the
> door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent.”

- Excerpt From: The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien
